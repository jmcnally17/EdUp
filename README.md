## Task
[Welcome to Ed Up!](https://edup-schools.herokuapp.com/)

For our final project on the Makers Academy course, we are five students from the March 2022 cohort who have chosen to create a web app that will primarily be used for communication between schools and parents. Parents will be able to login to their accounts to check the latest notices, have a calendar with important dates and events marked by teachers, make payments to pay for any invoices for their child's education with text confirmation and also be able to have a live chat with staff from school.\
\
On the other hand, teachers will be able to login to their account, create notices to be displayed on the noticeboard, delete notices that are no longer applicable, mark important event and dates on the calendar for parents to see, delete marked calendar events, create invoices for parents to pay, and also be able to live chat with parents who wish to speak to them.\

Technologies used:
- [Heroku](https://edup-schools.herokuapp.com/) for hosting our app
- [Trello](https://trello.com/b/hBC2RJnc/final-project) for planning
- [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com) to model objects in MongoDB
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/) web framework for Node.js
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) for our frontend
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) for our backend
- [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database) for hosting our database
- [MaterializeCSS](https://materializecss.com/) for CSS
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for CSS
- [UnDraw](https://undraw.co/) for illustrations
- [StripeAPI](https://stripe.com/) for our Payment system
- [TwilioAPI](https://www.twilio.com/) for our text confirmation system
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for testing
- [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) for testing
- [Github](https://github.com/jmcnally17/EdUp) for hosting our code, version control and GithubActions used for CD



## Instructions
Clone this repository to your desired location using `git clone https://github.com/jmcnally17/EdUp.git` .\
\
Make sure you have the most recent update of Node - you can use [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) and follow the instructions to install it. Use `nvm install --lts` to install Node and then you can run `npm install` whilst in the main directory in your terminal to install dependencies for the backend. Use `cd client` to go into the client folder and do `npm install --force` to install dependencies for the front end.\
\
You will need to have mongoDB to be able to run this web app in it's intended manner, you can run the commands `brew tap mongodb/brew` and then `brew install mongodb-community@5.0` in order to install mongoDB. Then use `brew services start mongodb-community@5.0` to start MongoDB.\
\
You can run tests by using the command `npm test` to run our jest tests, and then use `cd client` and `npm test` to run React Testing Library.\
\
In order for the website to function, you will need to run the backend server on localhost by using `npm run start-dev` when in the main directory, and then using `cd client` and `npm start` to run the front end. You can then access the webpage by going on `localhost:3000`. To get the website fully functional with the (test) payment system and text confirmation, you will need to register for API keys at [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) and [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/), you can then create a `.env` file for the following:
- `API_KEY`, your API key for Stripe
- `AUTH_TOKEN`, your Auth token for Twilio
- `ACC_SID`, your account SID for Twilio
- `TWILIO_WHATSAPP`, your Twilio number on WhatsApp
- `WHATSAPP`, your number on WhatsApp


Your .env file should look something like this: (where ... is the rest of the string)
```
API_KEY='sk_test_51...'
AUTH_TOKEN="48..."
ACC_SID="AC..."
TWILIO_WHATSAPP="whatsapp:+14111111111"  
WHATSAPP="whatsapp:+441111111111"
```
If you wish to clear the database, use the command `mongo` while in the terminal, you can then use the command `use edup_app` to access the database. You can then use the commands `db.users.drop()` to clear the users, `db.notices.drop()` to clear the notices, `db.payments.drop()` to clear the invoices and also `db.calendars.drop()` to clear the calendar events.\

## Notes
Due to the nature of our product, we do not want people who are not authorised to be able to sign up - and so, only teachers/admins will be able to create user accounts for parents. In order for the general public to see our webpage and experience it, we have included a registration page (`/registration`) which can be used to create a teacher/admin account - this will not be in the final website. This admin account can then be logged into and then be used to create regular accounts intended for parents.
